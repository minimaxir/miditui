- `spy_thriller_theme.json`: A spy theme used in [the X demo](https://x.com/minimaxir/status/2005779586676842646). The `TimGM6mb.sf2` SoundFont is recommended.
- `epic_final_boss.mid`: An epic, high-tempo orchestral intro to a video game final boss. The `GeneralUser-GS.sf2` SoundFont is recommended.

_**Disclosure:** Both of these examples were generated by Opus 4.5 out of curiosity to see how well a LLM can actually generate music given specific constraints/prompt engineering, particularly since Opus 4.5's audio knowledge is primarily limited to voice transcription. Yes, Opus 4.5 can directly create MIDI files by using a Python tool._

_Your mileage may vary on the quality of said compositions._
